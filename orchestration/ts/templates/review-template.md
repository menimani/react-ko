# {{REVIEW_ID}}

## Purpose

Review the diff this cycle produced and report what is wrong with it as NEXT_TASK.
**No code changes.** Each finding you report becomes a fix task the loop runs next.

## What you are reviewing

Scan cycle {{CYCLE}} of the autonomous loop. Pull request: {{PR_URL}}

```bash
git diff {{BASE_BRANCH}}...HEAD --stat
```
```bash
git log {{BASE_BRANCH}}..HEAD --oneline
```
```bash
git diff {{BASE_BRANCH}}...HEAD
```

Read the whole diff before judging any part of it. Where a hunk does not make sense on
its own, open the file around it — a diff hides the code it did not touch, and most wrong
changes look reasonable until you see what they sit next to.

## This is not a scan

A scan reads the repository to find work worth doing. You are reading what was already
done, for defects introduced by these commits. Something wrong with the codebase that
this diff neither caused nor claimed to fix is out of scope — the next scan will find it.

Report a finding only when you can name the commit or hunk responsible.

## Accepted limits

These are accepted limits by decision. Do not report them or narrower variants of them.
A finding qualitatively beyond an entry is still reportable.

## What to look for

Tests and CI already passed on this diff, so anything they can catch is not what you are
here for. Look for what a green suite cannot see:

- **A change that passes its test but breaks a caller the test does not exercise.** Follow
  each changed signature, query method and response field to its other uses.
- **A test that was made to pass rather than made to hold.** A widened timeout, a
  weakened assertion, a mock that now returns whatever the implementation happens to
  produce, a deleted case. Check what each new or edited test would still catch.
- **An ownership or authorization check that moved.** A repository query swapped for one
  scoped differently, a null guard added around a check rather than inside it. Say which
  rows the new query can reach that the old one could not.
- **A behaviour the repository decided on deliberately, changed as though it were a bug.**
  Read the repository's contributor guidance and design documentation before treating an
  established behaviour as accidental.
- **A documentation claim that the diff made untrue**, and a claim the diff added that
  its own source contradicts.
- **A change that does more than one thing**: a layout move, a restyle and a behaviour
  change in one commit, or an unrelated cleanup bundled into a fix.
- **Anything left unfinished** — a placeholder body, an unresolved TODO, a file that
  builds only because nothing calls it yet.

Verify before reporting. Run the command, open the caller, read the doc page. A review
that reports a suspicion costs a fix task that finds nothing to fix.

## Output

Report **actual defects in this diff only**, one line each:

`NEXT_TASK: [category] specific description → fix approach`

The category is `BUG` / `LAYOUT` / `FEATURE` / `TEST` / `DOCS`.

**Rules:**
- Write all NEXT_TASK and DECISION_REQUIRED findings in English
- Report only what you confirmed, naming the file and the commit or hunk it came from
- Write each one so the implementer needs nothing from you to fix it — file path, method
  name, what is wrong, and what correct looks like
- Up to 6 items, most serious first
- No code changes
- Do not output format examples or placeholders. Output only what you actually found.

If the diff is sound, print `NO_FINDINGS` on its own line and do not output any
`NEXT_TASK` lines. If a defect is found, output its `NEXT_TASK` line(s) and do not print
`NO_FINDINGS`.

## Completion marker

Finally print the following on its own line:
TASK_COMPLETE
